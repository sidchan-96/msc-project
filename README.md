# MSc Project Investigating the Power Efficiency of Numerical Software

## Description

This projects explored various methods of reducing the power consumption of a system while running Conjugate Gradient Method(CGM). The Conjugate Gradient Method is a common benchmark for EPC systems, although primarily used to examine the performance of a system, in this project CGM will be used to assess the power consumption of a system and how the power consumption could be reduced. 

The possible methods of reducing power efficiency would be to benchmark various CGM benchmarks to assess whether any are more power efficient than others, adjusting the data storage layouts since this is the most volatile part of the process and finally trying to reduce clock speeds and compare the change in performance against the reduction in power.
